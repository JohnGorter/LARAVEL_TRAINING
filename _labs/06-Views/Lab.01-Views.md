## Excercise 2: Make a logout view
Add a link to the homepage that lets a user logout, after successfull logout, redirect to the home page. 

## Extra exercise: Make a homepage that displays login/logout and current status
Update the homepage so it reflects the current logged in user by its name. So when a user is logged in, it should say 'Hello $user [logout]' otherwise it should say 'Login'.
