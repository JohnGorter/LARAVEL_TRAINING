## Labtime: 45 minutes

## Excercise 1. Review routes
Inspect all your previous created routes and make each route so it uses a controller. 
Make this controller by hand, no artisan make command.

I suspect you create around 4 controllers in this exercise. 

## Excercise 2. Create a Resource controller
Use the artisan make command to create a Resource Controller and use the constructor to create middleware. 
Configure your middleware so it uses your logging middleware you've already created earlier.
